# <img align="right" src="stasis.png"> stasis

A Clojure library of tools for developing static web sites.

## Install

Add `[stasis "0.1.0"]` to `:dependencies` in your `project.clj`.

## Another static site generator? Why?

I didn't want a static site *framework*, I wanted a *library*. If
you want a framework that makes it really quick and easy to create a
blog, you should take a look at these:

- [misaki](https://github.com/liquidz/misaki) is a Jekyll inspired static site generator in Clojure.
- [Madness](http://algernon.github.io/madness/) is a static site generator, based on Enlive and Bootstrap.
- [Static](http://nakkaya.com/static.html) is a simple static site generator written in Clojure.
- [Ecstatic](http://samrat.me/ecstatic/) creates static web pages and blog posts from Hiccup templates and Markdown.

They generally come with a folder where you put your blog posts in
some template language, and a set of configuration options about how
to set up your blog.

This is not that. This is just a set of functions that are pretty
useful when creating static web sites.

## Usage

Stasis works with a map of pages:

```clj
(def pages {"/index.html" (fn [request] "<h1>Welcome!</h1>")})`
```

The basic use case is to serve these live on a local server while
developing - and then exporting them as static pages to deploy on some
server.

#### Serving live pages locally

Stasis creates a Ring handler to serve your pages.

```clj
(ns example
  (:require [stasis.core :as stasis]))

(def app (stasis/serve-pages pages))
```

So just like with any Ring app, you point to this app var in `project.clj`:

```clj
{:ring {:handler example/app}}
```

Start the server and view your pages. Since `serve-pages` takes an
actual map, you can't actually add any pages live. That sucks. I'll
have to change that. :-)

#### Exporting the pages
