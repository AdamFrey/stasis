# stasis

A Clojure library of tools for developing static web sites.

## Install

Add `[stasis "0.1.0"]` to `:dependencies` in your `project.clj`.

## Another static site framework? Why?

I didn't want a static site *framework*, I wanted a *library*. If
you want a framework that makes it really quick and easy to create a
blog, you should take a look at these:

- https://github.com/liquidz/misaki
- http://algernon.github.io/madness/
- http://nakkaya.com/static.html
- http://samrat.me/ecstatic/
- https://github.com/thegeez/clj-static-blog

They generally come with a folder where you put your blog posts in
some template language, and a set of configuration options about how
to set up your blog.

This is not that. This is just a set of functions that are pretty
useful when creating static web sites.
